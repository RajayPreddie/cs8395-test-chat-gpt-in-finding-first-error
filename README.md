# cs8395-test-chat-gpt-in-finding-first-error

## Description
This repository is part of a research project titled "Enhancing Predictive Analysis of Python Code Errors: Integrating Semantic Similarity Assessment with ChatGPT". It aims to test the effectiveness of ChatGPT in identifying the first error in Python code. The project utilizes Python programs generated by ChatGPT from [this repository](https://github.com/RajayPreddie/cs8395-problem-generation), each containing a deliberate error. The python prgrams are stored in the coding_problems folder. Each python program is stored in a JSON in the coding_problems folder. The `main.py` script in this repository executes these programs, captures their standard error/output, and then uses ChatGPT to act as a command-line interface to compare ChatGPT's output with the terminal output. The code utilizes ChatGPT and difflib to then score how similar the outputs are. 

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone
```
Set up the environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Unix/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run `main.py` to execute the ChatGPT-generated Python programs. The script will capture errors, compare outputs using ChatGPT and `difflib`, and store the results in JSON format.

## Features
- **Error Detection**: Identifies first-error in Python programs using ChatGPT.
- **Output Comparison**: Compares the output of Python programs with ChatGPT-generated responses.
- **Semantic Similarity Assessment**: Utilizes `difflib` and ChatGPT to assess the similarity between program outputs.

## Output Explanation
Outputs are stored in:
- `gpt_responses`: JSON files each containing a ChatGPT response acting as a command-line interface.
- `json_problem_scores`: JSON files containing scores for each problem.
- `terminal_outputs`: Text files with terminal outputs when running the code.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please follow the existing code structure and document any changes.

## Additional Usage Instructions

### Command-Line Arguments
The `main.py` script supports the following command-line arguments:

- `--generate_responses`: Use this flag to force the generation of ChatGPT responses. This is useful when you want to regenerate responses for the Python programs.
  
  Example:
  ```
  python main.py --generate_responses
  ```
- `-- model`: This is here for integrating with the [cs8395/test-suite](https://github.com/nkalupahana/cs8395-test-suite). The input model is not used. The repository utilizes gpt-4.
